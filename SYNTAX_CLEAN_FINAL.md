# ✅ **CLEAN SYNTAX FIX - FINAL CI SUCCESS**

## 🎯 **Issue Completely Resolved**

The persistent syntax error has been eliminated by recreating the file with clean syntax!

---

## **🔧 **Final Fix Applied**

### **Root Cause**
- **Issue**: Persistent parsing error in `app/api/products/all/route.ts`
- **Problem**: Hidden syntax issues causing module parsing failures
- **Error**: `'import', and 'export' cannot be used outside of module code`

### **Solution**
- **Action**: Deleted and recreated the file completely
- **Result**: Clean syntax with proper module structure
- **Status**: TypeScript compilation now succeeds
